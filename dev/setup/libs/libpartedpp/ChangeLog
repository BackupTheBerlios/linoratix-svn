    * src/alignment.{cc,h}: Added missing ctors, operator=(), get() method.
                            Removed duplicate() and intersect() since they are
                            since they are now ctors.
    * src/constraint.{cc,h}: ditto.

    Removed set() methods from every class. Returning references where
    possible.

2003-03-04  Christian Meyer  <chrisime@gnome.org>

    * test/test2.cc: Fixed #include's. Removed comments from delete keywords.

2003-03-04  Christian Meyer  <chrisime@gnome.org>

    * src/timerhandler.cc: Fixed casting in c_handler_func().

2003-03-04  Christian Meyer  <chrisime@gnome.org>

    * src/device.{cc,h}: Removed C/C++ variables and baiscally put them into the
                         get() methods.
    * src/disk.{cc,h}: ditto. Improved dtor.
    * src/disktype.{cc,h}: ditto. get_name() returns a reference now.
    * src/filesystem.{cc,h}: ditto. Added missing ctors, operator=(), get()
                             methods. Some methods now return bool instead of
                             int.
    * src/filesystemtype.{cc,h}: ditto. Added missing operator=(). Added
                                 missing get() method.
    * src/geometry.{cc,h}: ditto. Added missing ctors, operator=(), get()
                           methods. Made get_c_geometry() const. Fixed a bogus
                           ctor. Removed static methods (which are now ctors).
    * src/partition.{cc,h}: ditto. Added missing ctors, operator=(). Renamed
                            get_partition() method. Returning references instead
                            of pointers in some methods. Some methods now
                            return bool instead of int. Improved dtor.
    * test/test4.cc: Added another test case.

    The strange segfault should to be fixed now. It seems like the gcc/g++ 3.x
    compiler has problems with initializer lists. Maybe it's a libparted
    issue.

2003-03-01  Christian Zeller  <chrizel@gmx.net>

    * src/Makefile: easier to handle
    * src/partedpp.h: added.

                         libparted.
                         get_length(), s/length/device_->length

2003-02-24  Christian Meyer  <chrisime@gnome.org>

    * test: added directory for test cases.
    * test/test1.cc: added (was test.cc in src/)
    * test/test2.cc: added (modified test.cc file)
    * src/device.cc: overall improvements and fixes.
                     using bool as return type where appropriate.
                     use of initializer list where possible.
    * src/disk.{cc,h}: added missing methods, removed private ones.
                       copy ctor is public now which is ped_disk_duplicate
                       in libparted.
                       using bool where appropriate.
                       use of initializer list where possible.
                       Some methods still aren't implemented yet.
    * src/disktype.{cc.h}: moved probe() method to class Disk.
    * src/geometry.{cc,h}: improved class a bit, more work's still needed.

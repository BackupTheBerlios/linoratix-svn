libpartedpp 0.1 (2003-03-27)
----------------------------

* API should be stable
* timer class is not complete yet
* private ctors in filesystem aren't finished (hence timer)
* started documentation (buggy, incomplete)

libpartedpp is considered as beta. It certainly contains some bugs but should
mostly work. The testcases in test/ are properly working and are nice examples
how to code with the library.

#
# Terminal permissions
#
#	TTYGROUP	Login tty will be assigned this group ownership.

#
# If you have a "write" program which is "setgid" to a special group

# TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
#
TTYGROUP	tty
TTYPERM		0600

#
# Login configuration initializations:
#

#	KILLCHAR	Terminal KILL character ('\025' = CTRL/U).
#	UMASK		Default "umask" value.
#	ULIMIT		Default "ulimit" value.
#
# The ERASECHAR and KILLCHAR are used only on System V machines.
# The ULIMIT is used only if the system supports it.
# (now it works with setrlimit too; ulimit is in 512-byte units)
#
# Prefix these values with "0" to get octal, "0x" to get hexadecimal.
#

# If "yes", the user must be listed as a member of the first gid 0 group
# in /etc/group (called "root" on most Linux systems) to be able to "su"
# to uid 0 accounts.  If the group doesn't exist or is empty, no one
# will be able to "su" to uid 0.
#
### (pam) SU_WHEEL_ONLY	no

#
# If compiled with cracklib support, where are the dictionaries
#
CRACKLIB_DICTPATH	/var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict

#
PASS_CHANGE_TRIES	5

#
# Warn about weak passwords (but still allow them) if you are root.
#
PASS_ALWAYS_WARN	yes

#
# Number of significant characters in the password for crypt().
# Default is 8, don't change unless your crypt() is better.
# Ignored if MD5_CRYPT_ENAB set to "yes".
#
#PASS_MAX_LEN		8

#
# Require password before chfn/chsh can make any changes.
#
CHFN_AUTH		yes

#
# Which fields may be changed by regular users using chfn - use
# any combination of letters "frwh" (full name, room number, work
# phone, home phone).  If not defined, no changes are allowed.
# For backward compatibility, "yes" = "rwh" and "no" = "frwh".
# 
CHFN_RESTRICT		rwh

#
# Password prompt (%s will be replaced by user name).
#
# XXX - it doesn't work correctly yet, for now leave it commented out
# to use the default which is just "Password: ".
#LOGIN_STRING		"%s's Password: "

#
# Only works if compiled with MD5_CRYPT defined:
# If set to "yes", new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based
# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to "no" if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don't understand the new algorithm.  Default is "no".
#
#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	no
### (pam)

#
# List of groups to add to the user's supplementary group set
# when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
# setting).  Default is none.
#
# Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
# access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.
# How to do it is left as an exercise for the reader...
#
#CONSOLE_GROUPS		floppy:audio:cdrom
### (pam)


#
# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?
# Default in no.
#
DEFAULT_HOME	yes

#
# If this file exists and is readable, login environment will be
# read from it.  Every line should be in the form name=value.
#
### (pam) ENVIRON_FILE	/etc/environment

#
# If defined, this command is run when removing a user.
# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by
# the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).
#
#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# If defined, either full pathname of a file containing device names or
# a ":" delimited list of device names.  No password is required to log in
# as a non-root user on these devices.
#
#NO_PASSWORD_CONSOLE tty1:tty2:tty3:tty4:tty5:tty6

#
# When prompting for password without echo, getpass() can optionally
# display a random number (in the range 1 to GETPASS_ASTERISKS) of '*'
# characters for each character typed.  This feature is designed to
# confuse people looking over your shoulder when you enter a password :-).
# Also, the new getpass() accepts both Backspace (8) and Delete (127)
# keys to delete previous character (to cope with different terminal
# types), Control-U to delete all characters, and beeps when there are
# no more characters to delete, or too many characters entered.
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to 1 results in more traditional behaviour -
# exactly one '*' displayed for each character typed.
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to 0 disables the '*' characters (Backspace,
# Delete, Control-U and beep continue to work as described above).
#
# Setting GETPASS_ASTERISKS to -1 reverts to the traditional getpass()
# without any new features.  This is the default.
#
#GETPASS_ASTERISKS 1

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# This also enables userdel to remove user groups if no members exist.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes
